                <p style="color: black">
                  When it came to designing my first Personal Website I felt a little scared. I was always used to designing websites as I did it in my free time, but something about designing a site for everyone to
                  see and scrutanise is always scary at first. The first version of my website, looking back on it, was awful. Don't get me wrong, it had everything it needed. It had all of the information this site
                  has but it just didn't look as professional as I would have hoped it would. I used that website, which was deployed with AWS, for around 2 months. After the time had passed I started to get a little
                  fed-up of the current site and I wanted to completely re-do it. <br><br>I first needed to learn more about Web Development and familiarize myself a little bit more with some CSS libraries. I started 
                  with MaterializeCSS. This was a real game changer for me. Most won't know, I was infact aiming to be a Graphic Designer when I grew up. I always used to design logo's, desktop backgrounds, and
                  so much more. I always envisioned myself doing it for the rest of my life, but things changed. I got to College and I realised that Graphic Design in a real world setting compared to doing it freelance
                  and making whatever you want, is drastly different. I didn't enjoy it at all. I then got introduced to the world of coding, I realised I could make whatever I wanted, I realised I could design anything i wanted.
                  This power was something I never realised I could have, and I had it. It felt amazing. From that day on i've always learned about programming. <br><br>Anyway, back on topic. I wanted to upgrade the way
                  my website looked and this was something I needed to really think about. After a few weeks of messing around and planning, and don't forget (lot's of coding). I finally had a website I could upload.
                  It felt amazing. Everybody loved it, but I was not satisfied. This brings me onto my current website. I have completely changed everything I liked about the site and i've made it a lot better.
                  The once scary concept of a Personal Website is gone and i'm happy for everyone to see what i've managed to make.
